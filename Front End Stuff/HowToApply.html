			<h2> How to Apply </h2>
			<p> U.S. universities welcome applications from international students and appreciate the different life experiences and diversity they bring to a campus. If you're considering attending a U.S. university, it's strongly recommended you begin researching and preparing for university two years before you expect to enroll. </p>

			<h3> College Application Tips from the Experts </h3>
			<p>Hear from international admission officers, college counselors and other education professionals from various institutions and organizations about what you need to focus on when it comes to applying for university. Annie Gingerich, a coordinator of international education at the Colorado Mesa University in Grand Rapids, Colo., provides us with some helpful tips:

            International students beginning to apply to U.S. universities may become easily overwhelmed, but focusing on the steps below will make the process less daunting for you.</p>
			<ol> 
				<li> Start the application process early and narrow your search to three to five schools. </li>
				<li> Contact the international student advisor at each university. Introduce yourself, explain that youâ€™re getting ready to apply, and ask any questions you have about their specific application process. </li>
				<li> Read and re-read the application requirements, as each university is different. Be sure to provide official documents when requested.</li>
				<li>If you are deciding between different schools, ask the international student advisor for a contact of a student from your same country already at the university so you can get their perspective. </li>
				<li>Most importantly, always research your options, ask a lot of questions and make connections!</li>
