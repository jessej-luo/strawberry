			<h2> Essay Tips </h2>
			<p> Essays are what differentiates you from any other applicant. When admissions officers read your essay, they get an idea of who they're considering: a talented musician, a pro-gamer, a humanitarian, or an idealist. This is your one chance to break away from the standard metrics and numbers that define you. Take advantage of this opportunity and right something about you or your life that makes you different. </p>
			<br>
			<h3> DO NOT WRITE ABOUT THE FOLLOWING TOPICS </h3>
			<ol> 
				<li> Your role model. Remember, this essay is about YOU. Write about the effects the role model had on you, but don't write a narrative about him/her. </li>
				<li> Non-thoughtful. You don't need to write about how you ponder the mathematics behind the universe, but write something thoughtful and educational. Write about the profound life differences in your country versus a trip elsewhere, or the intense challenge you've had with a difficult problem, or even a walk down the street. As long as the response shows thoughtful consideration, you will be fine. </li>
				<li> Do not pretend to be someone you aren't. An essay that is ingenuine is easy to distinguish from the rest; it lacks a true voice and meaning. Write from your heart: talk about what you truly value, recall what truly makes you different.</li>
			</ol>
